== Notes ==

- *const* declares a constant value.

- Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.

- A numeric constant has no type until it's given one, such as by an explicit conversion.

- A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires, one such as a variable assignment or function call.
