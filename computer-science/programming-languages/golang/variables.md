= Variables | Golang =

== Notes ==

- *var* declares one or more variables.
 
- You can declare multiple variables at once.
 
- Go will infer the type of initialized variables (i.e, f := "apple", compiler infers "apple" as a string)

- The := syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable. (var f string = "apple", also can be written as, f := "apple")

- Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued. for example, the zero value for an int is 0
